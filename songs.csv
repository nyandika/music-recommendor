You're the boogie-body-rockin' queen


Step aside, I'm back again
So hype, so lit, adrenaline

And I'd go to third base, but I'd never tell that
I got bleach in the blonde like Pamela
And I'm steppin' out the box like Shangela
I got long thick legs, a tarantula
And if you call me kitty girl, I can handle ya

Where I'm Headed,"Lene Marlin,Marion Ravn","norwegian pop,candy pop",Lene Marlin,"I've got a suitcase in my hand
Filled with stuff most precious to me
Sidewalk brings my feet
Wherever they're headed.
There is no directions given
Just some trust in human mind to rely on
And to hold on to.
Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
Won't even count the days.
One thing I sure know I won't move so fast
My mind in complete haze.

I pass by
Don't dare to stop
When there's someone I see
There's no one here but me
I'm fooled by something inside my head.
If I lay down now
I might seem kinda dead
Just keep on wasting time.

Scary thoughts and frightening sounds
In my mind still I try avoid it
Heading through this hope not one-way alley
I can't really sense my surroundings
Seems to be all dark around.
Nothing there, to lighten up my way.
Honestly don't know where I'll end up at last
Won't even count the days.
One thing I sure know I won't move so fast.

between the traffic and the ordinary sounds
I am thinking signs and seasons while a north wind blows through
I watch as lovers pass me by
Walking stories - whos and hows and whys
Musing lazily on love
Pondering you
I'll give it time, give it space and be still for a spell
When it's time to walk that way we wanna walk it well

I'll be waiting for you baby
I'll be holding back the darkest night
Love is waiting til we're ready, til it's right
Love is waiting

It's my caution not the cold
there's no other hand that i would rather hold
the climate changes, I'm singing for the strangers about you
don't keep time, slow the pace
Honey hold on if you can
the bets are getting surer now that you're my man

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older

I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me

All alone

Never knowing who to trust like this

Who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers cause my name's a reminder
Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

here’s to all my dreams come true
in the form of an american man

he’s got a lot of manly man things, to be sure
he brings them all to the table
along with gourmet dishes
whatever my wish is that day, he makes it happen
‘cause he is the american dream man
come one, come all and pinch your side
to see if maybe you’re dreaming
‘cause i have to do it all the time

just try to find another one

Get my new boots on

I put my hand in my father's glove

I run off
Where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown

I hear a voice,

'Cause I can't always be around.""

When you gonna love you as much as I do

As winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun

Years go by
And I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was

Mirror mirror
Where's the crystal palace
But I only can see myself

Skating around the truth
Who I am
But I know, dad, the ice is getting thin

Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it
Now, will it be my fault if I
Take your love and throw it wide
You might restrain me
But could you really blame me
And you will feel you're blown apart
All the pieces there
Will fit to make you whole
And I know where they go
When I kiss your mouth, I want to taste it
Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it"

The memories stay
They loop their lies on endless replay, oh
Been sleeping where I fall if I can sleep at all
'Cause I wake where I wanna if I wake at all
To see the lines are blurred, reality deferred
And we're chasing down tomorrow

Waking to find that we are kings and queens

Let's ditch the dark babe, we just gotta ride on, oh
Don't let lies through
They'll trick your mind and turn your heart to stone
Forget the wars we fight, forget the tears you cry
'Cause we go where we wanna but that won't be tonight
To see the edges fade between the light and shade
And we're chasing down forever, oh
We've got a long way to go but we got the energy

A Sorta Fairytale,Tori Amos,"art pop,ectofolk,lilith,melancholia,new wave pop,permanent wave,piano rock,pop rock,singer-songwriter",Tori Amos,"On my way up north
Up on the Ventura
Pulled back the hood
And I was talking to you
And I knew then it would be
A life long thing
But I didn't know that we
We could break a silver lining
And I'm so sad
Like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (a sorta fairytale with you)

Things you said that day
Up on the one-oh-one

I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us
You said that you'd take it
As long as I could
I could not erase it
And I'm so sad

I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you

And I ride alongside you then
And I rode alongside you then
And I rode along side 'till you lost me there in the open road
And I rode along side till the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread
For me to take your word
I had to steal it
And I'm so sad
Like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (a sorta fairytale with you)
I could pick back up whenever I feel
Down New Mexico way
Something about the open road
I knew that he was looking for some Indian blood and
Find a little in you find a little in me
we may be on this road but
We're just impostors in this country you know
So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver Stone
Till I almost smacked him seemed right that night and
I don't know what takes hold
Out there in the desert cold
These guys think they must
Try and just get over on us
And I'm so sad
Like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you

And I was ridin' by
Ridin' along side
For a while till you lost me
And I was ridin' by
Ridin' along till you lost me
'Till you lost Me in The rear view
You lost me I said
Way up North I took my day
All in all was a pretty nice day and
I put the hood right back where
You could taste heaven perfectly

Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone
Any given time or place I never will forget the disgrace on your face
So full of love, will it ever be enough?

Still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone
You help pass the time, but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long?
No, you don't belong to me, I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, it's hard to be strong

When you're holding on to someone that you gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye
I don't regret it
The time we had together
I won't forget it
But we both ended up where we belong
I guess goodbye made us strong
And yeah I'm happy
I found somebody too, who makes me happy
And I knew one day I'd see you on the street
And it'd be bittersweet
But as bad as it was
As bad as it hurts
I thank God I didn't get what I thought that I deserved
Sometimes life leads down a different road
When you're holding on the someone that you, gotta let go
Someday you'll see the reason why
Yeah sometimes, yeah sometimes
There's good in goodbye
As bad as it was
Yeah as bad as it hurt

Tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone my wife and I
Before we married saved my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside
But off the boat they stayed awhile then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most
I take a walk
I take a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)
Practice isn't perfect but the market cuts the loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
There's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife
But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments now the accounts are overdrawn
I take a walk
I take a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)
Honey, it's your son I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
And tomorrow you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward, to admit when I'm in need
I take a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)
I take a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)
I take a walk
(Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk...)
I take a walk

Hosea's Wife,Brooke Fraser,"nz christian,nz pop,worship",Brooke Fraser,"I just spoke silence with the seeker next to me
She had a heart with hesitant, halting speech
That turned to mine and asked belligerently
""What do I live for?""
I see the scars of searches everywhere I go
From hearts to wars to literature to radio
There's a question like a shame no one will show
""What do I live for?""
We are Hosea's wife
We are squandering this life
Using people like ladders and words like knives
If we've eyes to see
If we've ears to hear
To find it in our hearts and mouths
The word that saves is near
Shed that shallow skin
Come and live again
Leave all you were before
To believe is to begin
There is truth in little corners of our lives
There are hints of it in songs and children's eyes
It's familiar, like an ancient lullaby
What do I live for?
We are Hosea's wife
We are squandering this life
Using bodies like money and truth like lies
If we've eyes to see
If we've ears to hear
To find it in our hearts and mouths
The word that saves is near
Shed that shallow skin
Come and live again
Leave all you were before
To believe is to begin
We are more than dust
That means something
That means something
We are more than just
Blood and emotions
Inklings and notions
Atoms on oceans",
